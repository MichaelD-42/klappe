# Decisions

Each entry: the decision and its reason. Full design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-16-klappe-design.md`.

## 2026-10-16

- **Stack: Vite + TypeScript + GSAP + D3 + markdown-it.**
  - Why: the spec stack. Cinematic camera, motion paths and charts need it.
  - npm works through px.
- **GSAP licence.**
  - GSAP is free under its "no charge" licence, but it is not open-source (not OSI-approved).
  - Accepted for internal decks.
- **Extra libraries approved by the user:** Vitest, vite-plugin-singlefile, world-atlas + topojson-client, lucide, @playwright/test.
  - Ask before adding any other library.
- **One folder per scene. Order comes from the folder-name prefix. No registry file.**
  - Why: parallel agents must not conflict on shared files. claude-advisor's script list and zone table were merge hotspots.
- **Sharing: git subtree at `klappe/` in each deck repo.**
  - Why: a plain clone works, an update is one command, and local fixes can be pushed back.
- **Images: human in the loop.**
  - Claude writes the prompt to `media/TODO.md`; the human generates the image in M365 Copilot.
  - Why: M365 Copilot has no image API. The Chat API returns text only.
- **One master GSAP timeline per canvas. Back cuts to the previous step's end state.**
  - Why: cheap, exact deep links. Effects then only need to be seekable, not reversible.
- **Build loop: an orchestrator, one builder per task, and three reviewers (technical, look and feel, content).**
  - The same loop can be used for deck building. The skill that would describe it is deferred.

## 2026-10-16 (browser driver)

- **E2E driver: Playwright's bundled Chromium (`chromium.launch()` from `@playwright/test`). No Edge fallback.**
  - Why: Edge has the policy `RemoteDebuggingAllowed=0`, so Playwright cannot drive it. The key `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Chromium` does not exist, so the bundled Chromium is not blocked.
  - The spike passed: `npx playwright install chromium` worked through the proxy, and `npm run test:e2e` passed 2/2.
  - The driver sits behind `runSelftest(url, viewport?)` in `tests/e2e/driver.ts`. A different driver can replace it without touching the tests. The Edge `--dump-dom` fallback was not ported.

## 2026-10-16 (agent discovery)

- **Claude Code does not find agents or skills in nested `klappe/.claude/`. Deck repos must sync them with `node klappe/bin/sync-claude.mjs` (deck script name: `klappe:sync`).**
  - Test: scratch repo `deck-probe/` with the klappe repo cloned to `deck-probe/klappe/`. `claude -p` run from `deck-probe/` listed no `klappe`, `klappe-builder` or `klappe-review-*` entries, with two different prompts (it listed only user and plugin skills and the built-in agent types).
  - After `sync-claude.mjs` copied the files to `deck-probe/.claude/`, the same prompt listed `klappe`, `klappe-builder`, `klappe-review-content`, `klappe-review-look` and `klappe-review-tech`.
  - The script copies only `klappe*` names and overwrites them. It leaves the deck's own agents and skills alone.
  - Not tested: `claude` run interactively (only `-p` was tested).
- **Open TODO (see also the skill decision below):** add `klappe:sync` to the deck template docs when the template exists (M4).

## 2026-10-16 (skills deferred)

- **No klappe skill for now. The stub is removed. The four build-loop agents stay.**
  - Why: a skill written before any real deck is a guess. Skills will be written from experience (reverse-engineered from chat logs) after a few real decks exist.
  - `bin/sync-claude.mjs` still copies `klappe*` skills if any exist later.

## 2026-10-16 (M1 engine core)

- **Content-dependent e2e tests use in-code fixtures (`?fixture=two-scenes`, `?fixture=broken-step-count`).**
  - Why: `klappe test` must stay green in deck repos, where the demo deck is not present.
- **Each step is padded 1 ms before and after its content.**
  - Why: zero-duration tweens leaked into the previous step's label state on seek and play.
- **Reduced motion turns camera flights into cuts and nothing else.**
  - Why: spec §7 says camera flights become cuts. `?instant=1` is separate and seeks every play.
- **`place()` is the scene's home frame. The engine flies there on entry; `ctx.camera.to` is for moves after that.**
  - Why: one rule for entry; scenes do not write their own entry flight.
- **The acceptance suite (AC-1..8) runs on the demo deck only.**
  - Why: it checks the engine, and the demo is the one deck that is always present.
- **Deck code imports types from `klappe/types`. Deck repos map it in `tsconfig.json`; `klappe init` writes the file.**
  - Why: the same import works in the klappe repo and in a deck repo, with no relative paths into the subtree.

## 2026-10-19 (M2 fx foundation)

- **`onUpdate` may write the DOM, but only as a pure function of the tween's progress.** `onComplete` and `.call()` still must not change state.
  - Why: typing text, count-up numbers and canvas swarms need it, and a value computed from progress is the same after play and after seek.
  - The self-test snapshot records the text of `[data-k-text]` elements and the `data-k-progress` attribute, and skips anything under `data-k-ignore` (CSS loops, video).
- **The engine seeks canvas timelines with events on (`tl.seek(label, false)`).**
  - Why: GSAP's `seek()` suppresses callbacks by default, so `onUpdate` never ran on a deep link and typed text stayed empty. The walk's reset seeks to 0 the same way, so it now catches an `onUpdate` that is not a function of progress.
- **The `transition` event reports the transition that actually played.** A transition that throws (an effect not built yet, or a bug) falls back to `fade` and logs with `console.error`.
  - Why: the move must land; the log makes the self-test fail, so the fallback is never silent.
- **The default renderer falls back quietly to M1 text when the `shout` stub is not built yet.** A media step whose effect is missing shows "EFFECT MISSING: <kind>" and records a problem.
  - Why: the demo walk must stay green during Wave 1; missing media must be visible.
- **Helpers record deck problems through `ctx.problem(msg)`.** They are kept on the canvas runtime, and the self-test adds them to its problems.
- **`SectionModule.transition` is the literal union `TransitionKind` in `types.ts`; the registry must satisfy `Record<TransitionKind, Transition>`.**
  - Why: the same type as `keyof typeof registry`, but `klappe/types` stays free of imports, so a deck repo's tsc does not pull in the renderer.
- **Section text gets the size check only, and only where it overlaps the stage.** Scene text keeps both the size and the inside-the-frame check.
  - Why: a canvas-wide backdrop (stream labels, map markers) always reaches past the camera frame.

## 2026-10-19 (M2 effects and demo)

- **Transitions other than `cut` and `fade` play before the target step. A `reveal` label on the transition timeline starts the step early.** (Rulings R2, R7.)
  - Why: `cut` and `fade` keep the M1 timing, so AC-5 and the M1 feel hold. `zoom` sets `reveal` where the new canvas starts to grow, so its content grows in instead of popping in after an empty canvas.
- **No second look review for polish-only changes after a look review passed, when tests pin the look.** (Ruling R8.)
  - Why: the demo screenshots in Wave 2 catch a visual slip at lower cost.
- **The CRT count-up is opt-in per line: `{ text: "MEMORY TEST: 640K OK", count: true }`.** (Ruling R10.)
  - Why: a line that counts because a regex matched it is hidden magic. A count line that does not match the pattern is a deck problem, not a silent plain line.
- **A shatter step may seek its canvas timeline to the current end at load, copy and measure the target there, and seek back.** Transitions may create overlay DOM at play time. (Ruling R12.)
  - Why: the shards must show the target as the deck shows it at that step, including text written from `onUpdate`. Step adders run at load, so "all DOM exists at load" still holds. Transition timelines are standalone and never seeked; a back move is a cut.
  - AC-9 tests the in-scene shatter. The back cut across the shatter transition is covered by `tests/e2e/fx-shatter.e2e.test.ts`.
- **The `zoom` transition scales the layer that holds all canvases, never the target canvas's own transform.** (Ruling R13.)
  - Why: the camera stays the only owner of a canvas pose, so the target step can fly the camera while the canvas grows in.
- **"Sample data" shows only for the explicit marker: `source: klappe demo sample` in the data, or `sample: true`.** (Ruling R14.)
  - Why: matching the word "sample" anywhere would label real data as sample data.
- **The demo deck walks clean: zero problems.** AC-10 and AC-11 (missing data and image, the TODO files) run on the fixture deck `acceptance-todo`. (Ruling R16.)
  - Why: a red problems panel in the showcase deck contradicts "a deck walks clean" and would make every deck-level test meaningless. The fixture also keeps AC-10 and AC-11 green in deck repos.
- **AC-8 starts auto-play 3 steps before the end.** (Ruling R18.)
  - Why: the demo grew to 53 steps; from step 0 auto-play cannot reach the end within one check's 8 s budget. The check still proves that auto-play reaches `end`, stops by itself, and stops on manual input. Auto-play through the long scenes is covered by the walk.
- **The `onUpdate` rule (see M2 fx foundation) held through M2.** CRT typing, the counter and the swarm canvas write the DOM from `onUpdate` as a pure function of progress, and the walk checks play against seek for each of them.
- **A video box has a theme-token border and its title as a caption underneath.**
  - Why: offline, a bare black box reads as a hole in the slide. The caption sits outside `data-k-ignore`, so the self-test checks its size.
