# Decisions

Each entry: the decision and its reason. Full design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-16-klappe-design.md`.

## 2026-10-16

- **Stack: Vite + TypeScript + GSAP + D3 + markdown-it.**
  - Why: the spec stack. Cinematic camera, motion paths and charts need it.
  - npm works through px.
- **GSAP licence.**
  - GSAP is free under its "no charge" licence, but it is not open-source (not OSI-approved).
  - Accepted for internal decks.
- **Extra libraries approved by the user:** Vitest, vite-plugin-singlefile, world-atlas + topojson-client, lucide, @playwright/test.
  - Ask before adding any other library.
- **One folder per scene. Order comes from the folder-name prefix. No registry file.**
  - Why: parallel agents must not conflict on shared files. claude-advisor's script list and zone table were merge hotspots.
- **Sharing: git subtree at `klappe/` in each deck repo.**
  - Why: a plain clone works, an update is one command, and local fixes can be pushed back.
- **Images: human in the loop.**
  - Claude writes the prompt to `media/TODO.md`; the human generates the image in M365 Copilot.
  - Why: M365 Copilot has no image API. The Chat API returns text only.
- **One master GSAP timeline per canvas. Back cuts to the previous step's end state.**
  - Why: cheap, exact deep links. Effects then only need to be seekable, not reversible.
- **Build loop: an orchestrator, one builder per task, and three reviewers (technical, look and feel, content).**
  - The same loop is used for deck building in the skill.
