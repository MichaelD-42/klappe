# Decisions

Each entry: the decision and its reason. Full design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-16-klappe-design.md`.

## 2026-10-16

- **Stack: Vite + TypeScript + GSAP + D3 + markdown-it.**
  - Why: the spec stack. Cinematic camera, motion paths and charts need it.
  - npm works through px.
- **GSAP licence.**
  - GSAP is free under its "no charge" licence, but it is not open-source (not OSI-approved).
  - Accepted for internal decks.
- **Extra libraries approved by the user:** Vitest, vite-plugin-singlefile, world-atlas + topojson-client, lucide, @playwright/test.
  - Ask before adding any other library.
- **One folder per scene. Order comes from the folder-name prefix. No registry file.**
  - Why: parallel agents must not conflict on shared files. claude-advisor's script list and zone table were merge hotspots.
- **Sharing: git subtree at `klappe/` in each deck repo.**
  - Why: a plain clone works, an update is one command, and local fixes can be pushed back.
- **Images: human in the loop.**
  - Claude writes the prompt to `media/TODO.md`; the human generates the image in M365 Copilot.
  - Why: M365 Copilot has no image API. The Chat API returns text only.
- **One master GSAP timeline per canvas. Back cuts to the previous step's end state.**
  - Why: cheap, exact deep links. Effects then only need to be seekable, not reversible.
- **Build loop: an orchestrator, one builder per task, and three reviewers (technical, look and feel, content).**
  - The same loop is used for deck building in the skill.

## 2026-10-16 (browser driver)

- **E2E driver: Playwright's bundled Chromium (`chromium.launch()` from `@playwright/test`). No Edge fallback.**
  - Why: Edge has the policy `RemoteDebuggingAllowed=0`, so Playwright cannot drive it. The key `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Chromium` does not exist, so the bundled Chromium is not blocked.
  - The spike passed: `npx playwright install chromium` worked through the proxy, and `npm run test:e2e` passed 2/2.
  - The driver sits behind `runSelftest(url, viewport?)` in `tests/e2e/driver.ts`. A different driver can replace it without touching the tests. The Edge `--dump-dom` fallback was not ported.

## 2026-10-16 (agent discovery)

- **Claude Code does not find agents or skills in nested `klappe/.claude/`. Deck repos must sync them with `node klappe/bin/sync-claude.mjs` (deck script name: `klappe:sync`).**
  - Test: scratch repo `deck-probe/` with the klappe repo cloned to `deck-probe/klappe/`. `claude -p` run from `deck-probe/` listed no `klappe`, `klappe-builder` or `klappe-review-*` entries, with two different prompts (it listed only user and plugin skills and the built-in agent types).
  - After `sync-claude.mjs` copied the files to `deck-probe/.claude/`, the same prompt listed `klappe`, `klappe-builder`, `klappe-review-content`, `klappe-review-look` and `klappe-review-tech`.
  - The script copies only `klappe*` names and overwrites them. It leaves the deck's own agents and skills alone.
  - Not tested: `claude` run interactively (only `-p` was tested).
